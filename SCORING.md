# Scoring

## Options for scoring systems

1. 1 point for each correct prediction (max. 24) - e.g. 2014 & 2015
2. 1 point for each correct prediction, weighted by category. (max. 24 * sum of weights) - 2016 & 2017
3. each category is worth the number of players / divided by the number of correct predictions for that category

  > for 10 predictions for best picture, 4 are right. Those four each receive 10/4=2.5 points 
  > for 10 predictions for best actress, 7 are right. Those seven each receive 10/7 points

4. As 3 above, but additionally weighted by category
5. Weight each _nominee_ within a category according to some criteria, say bookmakers' odds

  > for best actress, Streep has odds of 3/1, Hawkins has 2/1. A correct bet for Hawkins is worth 3 pts
  > A correct bets for Streep is worth 4 points.

6. Provide virtual money and allow players to bet different amounts on each category
7. As 6 above, but cap amounts on each category
