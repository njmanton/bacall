Looking at scoring a number of different ways for 2019. 
* number of categories correctly predicted
* weighted score (current scoring mechanism)
* scaled points - each category is worth points equal to the number of predictions, shared across all correct predictions

example. For 11 players, if everyone picks the same winning nominee (e.g. _Shallow_), they each score `11/11` points
For a category where only two players predicted the correct winner, then they both score `11/2 = 5.5`
