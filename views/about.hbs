    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>This is the 10th M20YQH Oscars prediction contest. It's free to enter (bragging rights are the only prize). To sign up, go back to the <a href="/">home</a> page and enter your name (as you want it to appear in the results) and email address (so you can be sent your unique login code).</p>
    <p>Images have been provided by <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org">themoviedb</a></p>

    <h4>Changes</h4>
    <p>This year there is a <a href="/live">live chart</a> showing the score progress through the night in order of awards given, and you will see a progress indicator on the predictions screen, showing for which categories you still have a porediction to make.</p>
    <p>There will also be a couple of 'bot' ({{>robot }}) players, such as one that makes random picks or one that picks the bookies' favourites - the idea being you can benchmark yourself against these - you should be doing better than random chance, and getting close to the experts' scores means you're doing quite well. (You can always hide them on the <a href="/scoreboard">scoreboard</a>).</p>
    <p>I've removed the 'franchise' option when siging up, since that hasn't really been used since I added it.</p>

    <h4>Privacy</h4>
    <p>You will only get one email to confirm sign up and one with the final results. Email addresses and any other personal information will not be used for any other purpose.</p>
