      <p>Welcome to the tenth anniversary of the My 20 Year Oscar Hell competition - which means somehow it's lasted longer than WWII or The Beatles' recording career (though still shorter than the LotR Blu-Ray extended edition). Back then, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/76203-12-years-a-slave">12 Years a Slave</a> ran out the Best Picture Winner, with McConaughey and Blanchett taking the major acting awards (well, one of them might repeat this year), and the predictions were a very low tech <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/192ZVzyPeeeNwzYTydXwch26BkVJcfSxKds-ZBmvO5mM/edit#gid=0">spreadsheet</a>.</p>
      <p>No matter what the scoring system is, <em>someone</em> will complain, so I'm making no changes this year. The scoring will remain as <code>âˆš(correct predictions/all predictions)</code> for each category.
