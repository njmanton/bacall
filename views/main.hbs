      <p>Welcome to the My 20 Year Oscar Hell competition - now in its <em>tenth</em> version, which means it's somehow lasted longer than WWII or The Beatles' recording career (though shorter than the LotR Blu-Ray extended edition). Back then, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/76203-12-years-a-slave">12 Years a Slave</a> ran out the Best Picture Winner, with McConaughey and Blanchett taking the major acting awards. The prediction competition itself was a very <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/192ZVzyPeeeNwzYTydXwch26BkVJcfSxKds-ZBmvO5mM/edit#gid=0">low tech affair</a>.</p>
      <p>No matter what the scoring system is, <em>someone</em> will complain, so no changes this year. The scoring will remain as <code>âˆš(all predictions/correct predictions)</code> for each category. Other changes are detailed <a href="/about">here</a>.</p>
