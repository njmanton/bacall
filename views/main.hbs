      <h4>How it works</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Sign up below to get a unique <code>code</code></li>
        <li>(Optionally) add a team name to compare yourself to others in the team.</li>
        <li>Go to your predictions page (e.g. <code>https://baftas.mxxyqh.com/player/CODE</code>)</li>
        <li>Pick your winner for each of the 25 categories</li>
        <li>Correct predictions score points based on the number of predictions divided by the number of correct predictions.</li>
        <li>For example. If there were 10 predictions in a category and 4 were correct, those 4 would each score 10/4 = 2.5 pts.</li>
        <li>Thus, picking the 'favourites' for each category may result in more correct scores, but outsiders will score more points (if they winâ€¦)</li>
