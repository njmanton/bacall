<h2>My 20 Year Oscar Hell 2021</h2>

<p>Hi {{ username }}. Thank you for signing up to this year's M20YOH competition.</p>

<p>Your unique code is:</p>
<p><a style="font-size: 2em; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none; color: #db592e; " href="https://oscars.mxxyqh.com/player/{{ code }}">{{ code }}</a></p>
<p>Click on the code, or here <a href="https://oscars.mxxyqh.com/player/{{ code }}">https://oscars.mxxyqh.com/player/{{ code }}</a> to see your predictions page.</p>

<p>If you've taken part in previous years, a quick reminder of the rule changes this time:</p>
<p>Points for a category are no longer fixed, and now depend on the number of predictions made. For example, if there are 10 predictions with 4 correct, then each correct prediction scores 10/4 = 2.5pts. Therefore going for outside bets is risky, but comes with greater reward.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>
